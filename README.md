This project implements a Streamlit-based machine learning application leveraging Meta’s Prophet model to forecast housing prices along the East Coast of the United States. It analyzes historical home value trends while explicitly incorporating the effects of significant national and international conflicts on the real estate market. The model provides valuable insights into market dynamics, though it acknowledges inherent uncertainties and limitations—including unpredictable “black swan” events and behavioral factors—that can influence housing prices.

The interactive tool visualizes projected home values and offers users the ability to explore variations in average mortgage interest rates alongside price fluctuations associated with key geopolitical events. This functionality enables a nuanced understanding of how economic and conflict-driven variables have historically impacted the housing market and may shape future trends.

Prophet by Meta

This project utilizes Prophet, an open-source time series forecasting library developed by Meta (Facebook), designed to model complex temporal patterns such as seasonality, holidays, and trend changepoints. Prophet is well-suited for time series data characterized by strong seasonal effects, missing data points, and outliers, making it accessible to users with varying levels of statistical expertise.

Overall, this project offers a streamlined and lightweight approach to market evaluation over time, combining domain-specific insights with robust forecasting techniques to support data-driven decision-making in real estate investment.

Futher expansion of this project has included a compartive tool to evaulate fair market rental values in comparison to the estimated monthly mortgage cost with 20% down, assuming the predited price based on the prophet model. This intends to answer questions regarding appreciation of real esate in comparison to their cost for the average real estate investor on the Eastern Seaboard.
